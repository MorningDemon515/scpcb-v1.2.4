	Big thank you to everyone who's supported the project during these years, the game would have
	never gotten never gotten to where it is now without your help. 
	
	SCP-CB has been a big collaborative effort with dozens (maybe even hundreds?) of people 
	creating material and giving ideas and feedback for the game, and I'm sure I've forgotten 
	to mention some of you here. If you've contributed something to the game and would like your
	name to be in the credits as well, send me (Regalis) a PM in the forum.
