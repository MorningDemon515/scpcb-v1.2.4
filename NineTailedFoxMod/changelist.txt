    inform the users that a error/many errors happened (it will show how many errors occured before the
    console has been opened)

    gun ("USP Tactical" instead of "FN P90")

  * the game shouldn't crash at 25% if reloading it anymore
- the guns are now a bit animated if the player is idle
- changed Launcher/Menu/PauseMenu:
  * changed Launcher Background, Menu Background, "173"-Background, Pause Menu Background

  * now every StrictLoad-function (except "LoadMesh_Strict" and "LoadAnimMesh_Strict") now returning a error
    in the console rather than crashing the game
  * Image/Textures/Brushes if missing/couldn't be loaded replacing it's overlay with a "Missing-Texture"
    overlay
  * a missing/not loaded Font will be replaced with the "Arial" font
  * if a resource couldn't be loaded (if the Resource is existing, but couldn't be loaded due Blitz3D returned
    it's handle to be 0) will be loaded again, if it's still not working, then it will use the replacing method
- updated the "room3ct"-room:

  * the elevators are working in that room
  * this room has it's own theme ("hallways.ogg")
  * items added in the little "storage" part
  * a event added which adds three 049-2 (only two without aggressive NPCs) instances and 106
    (his chance on spawning there is 60%, with aggresive NPCs on, his chance of spawning is 90%)
  * added a NVG, a USP, a P90 and a dead scientist in the construction tunnels ("room3ct")
  * added a battery, a first aid kit and a S-Nav 300 Navigator inside the little storage area next to
    the elevators
- added a command to show all new added commands ("ntf help")
- added a new options tab (under options the button called "NTF-Mod Options")
  * now options such as "Disable Aim Cross" can be changed using the Options
- made the P90 more accurate

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.0.1 
- first release:
  * P90,USP,Crowbar as weapons
  * a small gun-storage room (room2gs) and a construction tunnel entrance room (room3ct)
  * added new MTF-NPC (MTF2, it doesn't see the player as a target to terminate), currently a broken AI
  * changed the system of the Ballistic Vest (by double clicking it in the Inventory, you would restore
    it's health and the "finevest" adds a little addition too)
  * 049-2 instances are damaging the Kevlar before the player gets Injuries and Bloodloss
  * the player spawns at the Gate-A Entrance rather than in 173-s Chamber (only if the Intro has been
    deactivated)
  * the Console won't open automatically if a sound couldn't be loaded (in my opinion it was pretty 
    annoying)
