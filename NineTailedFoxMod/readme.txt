**************************    SCP - CONTAINMENT BREACH   **************************
**************************	Nine Tailed Fox Mod	 **************************

***********************************************************************************

This is a modification for SCP:Containment Breach 1.1.5 and it changes the role from the test subject D-9341
to one of the E-11 MTF Units (or called "Nine Tailed Fox"). You have multiple tasks to do such as recontaining
SCPs and rescuing other SCP-personnel. You have guns such as the P90 to protect yourself and fight your way
through to survive one of the worst or even the worst containment breach. This mod will also have multiple
endings to encounter with different events that can happen.

Currently this mod is in a PreAlpha state (version 0.0.1) which is meaning that it has very few content.
This mod doesn't has many big changes and it will have more and more content added in every upcoming
updates.

**** HOW TO RUN IT (NTF-Mod Additional)/Advices**********

	- if you are in the main menu and start a new game, make sure to untick "Enable Intro Sequence"
	  before starting a new game
	- old save files will probably not work (not tested it currently)
	- the guns are unfinished, the bullets go through the NPCs
	- the room "room3ct" is unfinsihed
	- you can't escape through GateA (I removed the event so that the player is spawning properly)
	- the MTF-AI is currently broken (as it isn't using the player as a target any more)
	- if you have a map created using the map creator and you want to play it, make sure you placed
	  the room "gateaentrance" inside it
	- if you want to spawn an instance of the new MTF-NPC then you have to type into the console
	  "spawn mtf2" rather than "spawn mtf" because it would spawn the old aggressive MTF-NPC
